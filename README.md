# Automatic Detection of Defective Photovoltaic Modules by Aerial Thermographic Inspections
Utilize a thermal imaging camera and a drone to inspect the defective solar panel in a solar farm. A traditional way of finding defects is to walk on foot and inspect each panel one by one. This project can help reduce time and increase the frequency of the inspection.
